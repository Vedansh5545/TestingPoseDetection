Depth (“Z”) is by far the hardest part, because a single 2D skeleton has lost all direct distance information. Here are the simplest tricks and next-level ideas you can try—no heavy new models required, but these will give your current lifter real depth cues:

---

## 1. **Normalize your 2D to “real-world” coords**

Right now you feed raw pixel X,Y (0…W / 0…H) into the GCN.  The network then has to learn the camera projection rules from scratch.  Instead:

1. Subtract the image center $(c_x,c_y)$ so 0,0 is the camera principal point.
2. Divide by the focal length $f$ (in pixels):

   $$
     x_\text{norm} = \frac{u - c_x}{f},\quad
     y_\text{norm} = \frac{v - c_y}{f}.
   $$

   These normalized coordinates are proportional to real -space $X/Z,\;Y/Z$.
3. Feed $(x_\text{norm},y_\text{norm})$ into your lifter instead of raw pixels.

That way the network “understands” that if a point is closer, its normalized $x,y$ are larger for a given real-world shift.  You’ll see much better Z predictions once you incorporate camera intrinsics.

## 2. **Bone-length consistency loss**

Add a small penalty that forces each predicted bone to match its average length from your training data.  E.g.

$$
  L_{\text{bone}} = \sum_{(i,j)\in\mathrm{edges}} \bigl(\,\|p_i - p_j\|_2 - \bar{d}_{ij}\bigr)^2
$$

This “teaches” the network valid depth ranges—if it collapses everyone onto a flat plane, the bone-length loss will push Z apart.

---

## 3. **Depth-weighted loss**

If you find your network still underfits Z, explicitly weight Z-error more in your MPJPE:

$$
  L = \frac1N\sum_{k=1}^N \bigl[(x_k-\hat x_k)^2 + (y_k-\hat y_k)^2 + \alpha\,(z_k-\hat z_k)^2\bigr]
$$

Try $\alpha=2$ or 5 so the model cares more about getting depth right.

---

## 4. **Add simple image cues**

2D keypoints alone sometimes can’t resolve front/back ambiguity.  You can augment your lifter input with a small *patch* of image around each joint (e.g. a 16×16 crop flattened to a vector).  Now the network can see shading and perspective cues that hint at depth.

---

## 5. **Temporal smoothing (for video)**

If you’re lifting from a stream, enforce that depth changes smoothly over time:

$$
  L_{\text{temp}} = \sum_t \|\,\hat z_t-\hat z_{t-1}\|_2^2.
$$

This drastically reduces jitter and usually improves average depth accuracy.

### **Putting it into practice**

1. **Compute or look up** your camera’s $f, c_x, c_y$.
2. **Modify your preprocessing** in `detect_and_lift.py` (or `infer.py`) to convert pixel → normalized coordinates before you standardize/normalize as before.
3. **In `train.py`**, add one extra term to your loss:

   ```python
   # after your MPJPE loss:
   bone_loss = bone_length_weight * compute_bone_length_loss(pred3d, edge_index, avg_bone_lengths)
   loss = mpjpe + bone_loss
   ```
4. **Retrain** for a few epochs.  You should see Z-error drop dramatically.

Taken together, these steps give your existing Sparse-GCN+Transformer just the right geometric hints to “lift” into true 3D more accurately—without scrapping your model or data.
