SDG-RAT Model (Sparse Dynamic Graph + Routing Attention Transformer)
Overview
The SDG-RAT model is a novel neural architecture designed for 3D human pose estimation from 2D joint coordinates. It integrates sparse graph convolution with joint-wise transformer attention and learnable positional embeddings. The model is lightweight, modular, and accurate, offering depth-aware 3D reconstruction from a single image input.

Model Components
1. Learnable Positional Encoding
Instead of using static sinusoidal embeddings, this component uses a learnable parameter matrix to encode joint positions. Each joint gets a trainable positional vector that is updated during training to better reflect anatomical semantics.

2. Sparse GCN Blocks with Edge Importance
Two GCNConv layers are used to model spatial dependencies between joints. A learnable edge weight is associated with each skeleton edge, allowing the model to focus more on critical bones (e.g., torso, hip) during training. Each GCN block includes:

Residual connection

LayerNorm

ReLU activation

3. Routing Attention Transformer
This block applies a multi-head Transformer encoder over the joint embeddings. A routing bias is added to each joint token to guide attention flow — allowing joint-specific attention behavior. For example:

Hands may focus more on shoulders

Feet may attend to hips

4. Projection Decoder
This final component lifts the refined joint embeddings into 3D space using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP):

Linear → ReLU → Linear → Output (x, y, z)

Model Flow
Input shape: (B, 28, 3) — batch of 2D joints with dummy Z=0

Flattened and passed through Sparse GCN Block 1

Then through Sparse GCN Block 2

Reshaped to (B, 28, hidden_dim) and added to learnable positional encodings

Passed through Routing Attention Transformer

Output passed through Projection Decoder

Final output: (B, 28, 3) — predicted 3D joint coordinates

Innovations and Contributions
✅ Learnable Positional Embedding per joint (vs fixed sinusoidal)
✅ Routing Bias Attention — a new way to encode joint relevance in the Transformer
✅ Edge Importance Weights — learn how much each bone matters dynamically
✅ Fully modular design: ideal for ablation studies, extension to videos, or plug-and-play modules

Potential Extensions
Add camera projection model for reprojection loss

Add temporal encoder for video-based 3D pose estimation

Add multi-hypothesis decoding to handle depth ambiguity

Fuse with depth maps or segmentation masks for enhanced spatial priors
