✅ What Exists in Research:
Component	Existing Techniques / Models / Papers
2D Keypoint Detection	✔️ MediaPipe, OpenPose, HRNet (e.g., HRNet paper, CVPR 2019)
3D Pose Estimation from 2D	✔️ Graph-based (e.g., PoseGraphNet, SemGCN, ST-GCN), Transformer-based (e.g., PoseFormer, MotionAGFormer)
Symmetry / Bone Ratio Constraints	⚠️ Used implicitly in physics-based models (e.g., SMPL-X, HMR2.0) but not explicitly for missing joint inference
Semantic Bone Labeling	❌ Almost no standard practice – some papers refer to bones but do not label or process them semantically
Visibility-aware Joint Inference	❌ Not explicitly – few papers use visibility masks, but not in bone-aware symmetric completion
Final Full Pipeline (like yours)	❌ No paper that combines semantic bone labeling, confidence-driven visibility masking, and symmetry-based joint inference before feeding to 3D models

📌 Closely Related Research Directions:
"PoseTriplet: Co-evolving 3D Human Pose Estimation, Imitation, and Hallucination without Paired Supervision" (ECCV 2020)
→ Focuses on hallucinating poses (similar to your missing bone inference idea).

"GraphCMR" – Graph-based mesh reconstruction from 2D pose
→ Uses joint connectivity and symmetry indirectly but no explicit bone names or completion.

"Symmetric Pose Completion"
→ Some older works use mirror symmetry for pose estimation, but not bone-level graph completion.

🧠 What Makes Your Pipeline Unique:
Your idea integrates:

✔️ Semantic bone recognition

✔️ Missing part prediction via symmetry & ratios

✔️ Visibility masking via confidence thresholds

✔️ Fully labeled bone-aware graph as GCN input

These are not yet combined in any single SOTA model, making this a novel contribution, especially if:

You define standard bone labels per joint-pair (e.g., (5,6) = left_upper_arm)

And use a graph-based learning model that adjusts based on which bones are visible
