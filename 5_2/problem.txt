üß† Issue Summary: GCN Memory Overflow Due to Dense Graph on 2D Pose Input
üîç Problem Description
While running the bone_aware_inference.py script for 3D human pose estimation, the following error occurred:

RuntimeError: [enforce fail at alloc_cpu.cpp:114] data. DefaultCPUAllocator: not enough memory: you tried to allocate 73035167744 bytes.
This memory allocation failure is caused during the Graph Convolution step of the model.

üîß Root Cause
The error is traced back to the graph definition section:

python
Copy
Edit
adj_matrix = np.ones((num_joints, num_joints)) - np.eye(num_joints)
edge_index, _ = dense_to_sparse(torch.tensor(adj_matrix))
This creates a fully connected graph for all 33 joints, resulting in:


33√ó33=1089 edges (including self-loops),

When self-loops are removed: 

33√ó(33‚àí1)=1056 directed edges,

Which significantly increases GPU and CPU memory requirements for the GCN layer.

üß† Why This is a Problem
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) propagate messages across all edges in the graph. A fully connected graph:

Makes every node communicate with every other node, which is computationally expensive,

Is unnecessary because human skeletal structure has a sparse, biologically defined connectivity,

Overloads GPU memory for inference/training, especially on high-dimensional data or lower-spec hardware.

‚úÖ Solution: Use Sparse Bone Graph
Instead of a fully connected graph, define a sparse, biologically meaningful edge list using known human anatomy (e.g., MediaPipe or H36M style).

python

edges = [
    (11, 13), (13, 15), (12, 14), (14, 16),  # Arms
    (23, 25), (25, 27), (24, 26), (26, 28),  # Legs
    (11, 12), (23, 24),                      # Shoulders & Hips
    (11, 23), (12, 24)                       # Torso
]

edge_index = torch.tensor(edges, dtype=torch.long).t().contiguous().to(device)
This yields just 12 meaningful bone connections‚Äîdrastically reducing memory use while maintaining anatomical accuracy for graph learning.

‚úÖ Benefits of Sparse Bone Graph
Matches biological structure

Enables faster training and inference

Avoids memory overflow errors

Encourages meaningful message passing in GCNs

# üß† Issue Summary: GCN Memory Overflow Due to Dense Graph on 2D Pose Input

## üîç Problem Description
While running the `bone_aware_inference.py` script for 3D human pose estimation, the following error occurred:

RuntimeError: [enforce fail at alloc_cpu.cpp:114] data. DefaultCPUAllocator: not enough memory: you tried to allocate 73035167744 bytes.

This memory allocation failure is caused during the **Graph Convolution** step of the model.

---

## üîß Root Cause
The error is traced back to the graph definition section:

```python
adj_matrix = np.ones((num_joints, num_joints)) - np.eye(num_joints)
edge_index, _ = dense_to_sparse(torch.tensor(adj_matrix))
This creates a fully connected graph for all 33 joints, resulting in:

33 √ó 33 = 1089 total connections (including self-loops),

33 √ó (33 - 1) = 1056 edges when self-loops are removed,

This dramatically increases GPU and CPU memory requirements for GCN layers.

üß† Why This is a Problem
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) propagate messages across all edges in the graph. A fully connected graph:

Makes every node communicate with every other node (dense computation),

Is unnecessary because human skeletal structure is sparse,

Overloads memory, especially for GPUs on limited hardware.

‚úÖ Solution: Use Sparse Bone Graph
Replace the fully connected graph with a sparse, biologically accurate skeleton graph:

python

edges = [
    (11, 13), (13, 15), (12, 14), (14, 16),  # Arms
    (23, 25), (25, 27), (24, 26), (26, 28),  # Legs
    (11, 12), (23, 24),                      # Shoulders & Hips
    (11, 23), (12, 24)                       # Torso
]

edge_index = torch.tensor(edges, dtype=torch.long).t().contiguous().to(device)
This results in just 12 meaningful bone edges, reducing memory use and maintaining anatomical structure.

‚úÖ Benefits of Sparse Bone Graph
Matches actual biological structure

Enables faster training and inference

Avoids out-of-memory (OOM) errors

Supports efficient and meaningful GCN learning
